* Texas Instruments TVP5150 and TVP5151 video decoders

The TVP5150 and TVP5151 are video decoders that convert baseband NTSC and PAL
(and also SECAM in the TVP5151 case) video signals to either 8-bit 4:2:2 YUV
with discrete syncs or 8-bit ITU-R BT.656 with embedded syncs output formats.

Required Properties:
- compatible: value must be "ti,tvp5150"
- reg: I2C slave address

Optional Properties:
- powerdown-gpios: phandle for the GPIO connected to the PDN pin, if any.
- reset-gpios: phandle for the GPIO connected to the RESETB pin, if any.

The device node must contain one 'port' child node for its digital output
video port, in accordance with the video interface bindings defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Example:

&i2c2 {
	...
	tvp5150@5c {
			compatible = "ti,tvp5150";
			reg = <0x5c>;
			powerdown-gpios = <&gpio4 30 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
			reset-gpios = <&gpio6 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;

			port {
				tvp5150_1: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&ccdc_ep>;
				};
			};
	};
};
